## What's an Azure?

Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform. There are _A LOT_ of services you'll find there, from computing to storage, from security to DevOps, and everything in between. The best part? Most services are free or incredibly low cost at the volume most individuals and small businesses would use.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While Azure can be a cost effective platform, it can also be easy to accidentally rack up significant costs if resources are not provisioned and/or scoped properly. If you are new to the platform, I highly recommend reviewing the Intro to Cost Management guide

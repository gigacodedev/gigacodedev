## What will I find here?

I'll be organizing all my Cloud focused concepts here, and I expect this to be the most content rich section (at least starting out). I personally define cloud related items as really anything that isn't running on a local system, so this will include most Microsoft Online services such as Azure and 365. This section will be focused specifically on the configuration and management of cloud platforms. I expect some crossover of general development concepts, but ideally would like to have a section separately for the purely dev focused writings.

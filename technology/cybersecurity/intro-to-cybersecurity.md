## So, you want a career in cyber security

Welcome! Cybersecurity is a HUGE field, with a lot of opportunities. If we were to go overe *all* the things you can do, this doc would be about 10 miles long. Rather, we hope to answer some of the initial common questions we get about where to even start. With such a large field, the uncertainties of where to go and what to do are vast, so we're here to demystify some of that!

## Where do I even start?

### Brandon

Well, start by doing :). The biggest mistake I see is the "Perpetual Planning", where folks get so hyper focused on plotting what to do first they never actually start! **Something** must have piqued your interest in the field. Start there! See a TV show or movie that had some cool hacking effects? Look into the offensive side of security and poke at challenge boxes (listed later on). More interested in being a defender? Check out some free online courses of running blue team methodologies to protect environments
